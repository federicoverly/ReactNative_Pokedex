# ReactNative_Pokedex

This app was developed with React Native simulating a Pokedex. You can see the list of Pokemon and chose to go to the details of one.

## Getting started

After installing the dependencies run

```
npx react-native run-ios
# or
npx react-native run-android
```

This will automatically build the app and deploy it in your simulation.

## Libraries

### Axios

Axios is used to handle the api request to the Pokeapi. Make sure to check [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

### React Native Image Colors

Super interesting library to fetch the prominent colors of an image. Used here to change the background depending on the Pokemon. Take a look [here](https://npmmirror.com/package/react-native-image-colors)
